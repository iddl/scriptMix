scriptMix
=========

Chrome extension for detecting mixed scripting vulnerabilities.

Examines web requests in HTTPS pages looking for non-HTTPS content that can be altered using MITM attacks. Chrome does this automatically, I am writing this for fun.

Coming up: popup content listing vulnerable requests.
